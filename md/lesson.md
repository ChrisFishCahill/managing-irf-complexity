# Goals

- Understand general structure of the BERTA (Bayesian Estimation of Recruitment Trends in Alberta) model used in Cahill et al. (2021).
- Gain an overview of available options for modeling, including tweaking priors and MCMC run parameters.
- Become familiar with `browser()`, `get_fit()`, `future_pwalk()`. 
- Learn how these files are calling/subsetting data, fitting a model to those data, and then saving the model fit. 
- Practice debugging.
