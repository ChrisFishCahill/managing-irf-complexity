# Goals

- Understand general structure of BERTA model used in Cahill et al. (2021).
- Gain an overview of available modeling options, including tweaking priors and MCMC run parameters.
- Become familiar with `browser()`, `get_fit()`, `future_pwalk()`. 
- Learn how .R and .stan scripts are working together to subset data, fit a Bayesian stock reduction analysis model to those data, and then saving the model fit with a unique file name identifier.
- Practice debugging.
